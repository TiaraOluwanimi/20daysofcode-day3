          Hate stress, love food and socializing with friends? <br />We do, too!
        </h3>

        <p>
          TheFoodApp was started by a handful of food-obsessed friends who, like
          you, start thinking about what’s for dinner shortly after lunchtime,
          believe meals are best shared with loved ones, and are pretty sure
          social events that aren’t all about food should be considered a faux
          pas. We believe in the power of food to tell stories, enrich our daily
          lives, deepen our relationships with friends and family, and forge
          connections with the world around us. Plus, we are notorious for
          snapping pictures of each dish we eat before taking the first bite.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result is TheFoodApp: the social food-and-friends app that makes
          it easy for you to order food from your favorite restaurants and have,
          it delivered to your doorstep, host and attend food events, and share
          photos of your food experiences as they happen. SupperClub is all
          about eating well and building community -- in person, in the kitchen,
          and around the table
        </p>
        <p>
          Our app is perfect for pop-up restaurants, or just individuals who
          want to connect with friends and share their favorite food adventures.
          The mobile app will be available for iOS on July 10th, and an Android
          release slated for the summer of 2020. Won’t you join us at
          TheFoodApp?
          <br />Cheers!<br />
